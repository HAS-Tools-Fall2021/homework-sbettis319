Assignment 3

1. Flow, year, month, and day are all lists. Flow and year provide numerical 
data that is given by the data in the streamflow.txt file. Month and day
variables are numerical values associated with every month and days within
each month. Each list has a size of 11939. 

2. In the month of September, there were 591 days that predicted a 
discharge of over 100. This means that only 5% of the overall data
had a dicharge of greater than 100 cfs. 

3. There were 292 more times that the flow was greater or equal
than 100 before the year 2000 in September, which means that 2.4% of
the overall data. There were 179 more times that the flow was greater
or equal than 100 before the year 2010 in September, which means that 
1.5% of the overall data. 

4. In the first half of Sepetember in 2020, the flow is generally
smaller and then in the second half of September, the flow increases. 

#######

For this weeks assignment, I chose flow values of 100 cfs because there
should not be much rain, but the river should still be flowing in certain
areas. For the second week, I chose a value of 120 cfs going off of the
data collected from the second week of September data.
