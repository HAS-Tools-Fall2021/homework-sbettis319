Assignment 2

For assignment 2, I first looked at whether there was still a possibility for rain in the week coming
up and then I played around with the week 2 python starter to code. I searched for the past dates of
9/6 and 9/12 to see what the streamflow was like the previous years to come up with an estimate. I
searched for the streamflow on each of those dates every 5 years since 1990 and came up with a rough
average estimate for 9/6/21 and 9/12/21.

## Grade:
3/3 - Great job looking through the historical data!  I like your header next time try adding some markdown formatting to it.
