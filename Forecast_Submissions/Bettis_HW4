1. Provide a summary of the forecast values you picked and why. 
Include discussion of the quantitative analysis that lead to your
prediction. This can include any analysis you complete but must 
include at least two histograms and some quantitative discussion
of flow quantiles that helped you make your decision.

I think that the flow might increase at the end of September, also
based on last weeks prediction. For the first histogram, I just looked
at the average flow in all of September and the average for flow was
230.93 cfs when the flow was greater than 100. The flow in September
has an average value of 79.95 cfs when the flow is less than 100. 
I also did an average of all the years for when flow is less than 100 for the 20th of Sepetmber, is 82.3 cfs and when it is greater than 100
cfs, the value is 203.9 cfs. So, the value I chose for this week is 140 cfs and 150cfs for the 2nd week based on the same characteristics.

1. Describe the variable flow_data:

What is it?
Numpy (ndarray)

What type of values is is composed of?
It is composed of flow, month, year, and day data as integers.

What is are its dimensions, and total size?
The dimensions are 2 and the total size is (11936,4)

3. How many times was the daily flow greater than your prediction 
in the month of September (express your answer in terms of the 
total number of times and as a percentage)?

301 - 2.5%

4. How would your answer to the previous question change if you 
considered only daily flows in or before 2000? Same question for 
the flows in or after the year 2010? (again report total number 
of times and percentage)

2000 --> 317 - 2.6%
2010 --> 225 - 1.9%

5. How does the daily flow generally change from the first half 
of September to the second?

From the numpys I created, the flow in the second half of September is greater than the first half. The flow in the second half of September has a mean flow of 340 cfs and the mean flow of the first half of September is 275 cfs.
