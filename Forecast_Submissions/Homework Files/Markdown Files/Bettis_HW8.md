## Grade:
### 1. Forecast Submision: 
**2/3:** Good work on the analysis however your plots are not coming through and it is very hard to read because you have not done any markdown formatting. From now forward I will be taking off points for bot of these things. Please see me if you need help figuring these out and I'm happy to give you some pointers. Always make sure you  preview your markdown on GitHub before submitting this is the best way to make sure you see what I see. 

### 2. Graded Script
Refer to [the rubric](https://github.com/HAS-Tools-Fall2021/Course-Materials21/blob/main/Content/Starter_Codes/week7_code_review_rubric.md) for details on scoring: 
- **Readability:3/3** Great doc strings and commenting throughout the code. 
- **Style:3/3** No Pep 8 errors. You should consider a differnt name for your funciton though. Function is not very descriptive. 
- **Code:1.5/3**  I really like all of your graphs. -0.5 becuase I had to adjust the path to the data to get it to run and -1  becuase your funciton is not working. Right now you don't actually have anything inside of it and there is notihng being returned from it. If you stop by my office hours I'm happy to show you how to fix this.

1. An explanation of how you generated your forecasts and why?
   I generated my forecasts using the datetime and found the mean over a range of dates for each week. I did this so that I could get more of the values that I was looking for in my time frame.
2. The three graphs you are including with an explanation of why you chose these three graphs.

Graph 1: Flow in 2010-2020 from October 17-23
I chose to alter this graph 3 times to look at each week and then both weeks together as a whole.

Graph 2: Flow in 2010-2020 from October 24-30
Second iteration of the previous grapg, but for week 2.

Graph 3: Flow in 2010-2020 from October 18-30th (both weeks together)
Third iteration of the first graph, just seeing both weeks together and how the flow changes.

 Graph 4 : Box and Whisker plot showing the flow for everyday
I wanted this graph just to see general flow everyday and how much each day can fluctuate. It shows me that the flow values become more uniform towards the end of each month.

1. A brief summary of what you got out of the peer evaluation. How did you make your script better based on the feedback you received?
   I did get some helpful comments on adding doc-strings and also editing my code more to make have it follow the PEP8 style more. I also did take the advice of automatically saving the graphs and also changing the initial name of the function to be different than the output. 
2. A summary of how you are using timeseries functionality in your script.
Describe the part of your script that you are most proud of and why.
    I used the timeseries functionality to create my forecast for this week. I would say that I am most proud of my function and doc-string section.
