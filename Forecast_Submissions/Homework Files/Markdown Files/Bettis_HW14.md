Homework 14

1. The paper I picked is about data driven design of metal-organic frameworks (MOF) for wet flue gas CO2 capture. The authors aim to tackle limiting CO2 in the atmosphere by delevoping data of MOF's to see how they bond with CO2 and Nitrogen.

2. The repo associated with the article has lots of commits for warnings. The code is mostly python with about 9% being a mix of C++ and C. I have provided a link of the DOI that was provided as well as the link for the GitHub repo for the data. The third link is the interface for python and C coding that was provided.

3. The readme was very sparse with no real direction of how to run any of the data. It provided some installation of code and then talked about the usage of the code and where new data should be added. Inside of the python files, there were no comments in the code at all but for the functions there was brief explanation of what the function was there to do. 

4. I was not successful with the repo. When I tried to run it, I got of errors about a SBU file. 

5. The data had a DOI associated with it with 3 different files. All 3 of the files have huge datasets inside of them. Yes, the data is accessible but I think this repo and data are really only useful if you want to add to the data. It is not easy to download the data just to try and run it and see what the files create. 

6. This assignment taught me how important it is to comment scripts or even just explain how to use code in the readme. The main default of this project on MOF's is that the readme does not provide any guidance on where to first look in the code or a direction on what to run. The authors should definitley update and provide a path of where someone should start when looking at the repo. Additionally, it is interesting because the repo has commits from 7 months ago so it seems that the authors are still working on it and could definitley update to the FAIR standards.
