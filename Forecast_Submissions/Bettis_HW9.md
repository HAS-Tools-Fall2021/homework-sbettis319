____________
## Grade:
**2/3:** Good work but it looks like your graphhs are still not coming through.  Please make sure you see me and make sure you know how to fix this before your assignment next week. 
____________


1. A brief summary of the how you chose to generate your forecast this week.

This week I wanted to get the data using an additional source of data that I got from a rain gauge close by. I could not get that to run, so I found the median flow value for the forecasting weeks and had to use that as my prediction.

2. A description of the dataset you added.

    What is the dataset? Why did you choose it?

The dataset is an API that I chose so that I could make a better prediction of the forecasr, not just using the Verde River near Camp Verde data.

    What location have you chosen?

I chose to look at Montezuma Castle near Camp Verde.

    Where did you get the data from?

I got the data from the USGS and then used the mesonet data.

    What was your approach to accessing it?

I used the metadata website to look for a station, got the parameters needed and wanted to run the API for precipitation.

3. A plot of your additional time series along with your streamflow time series.

I could not get my metadata to work properly. The error was saying that the key error was "STATION".

4. A plot that illustrates how you chose your forecast values.

The first graph shows the flow values from 2010-2019 for the last week of October
