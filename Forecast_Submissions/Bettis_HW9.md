1. A brief summary of the how you chose to generate your forecast this week.

This week I wanted to get the data using an additional source of data that I got from a rain gauge close by. I could not get that to run, so I found the median flow value for the forecasting weeks and had to use that as my prediction. 

2. A description of the dataset you added.
   
    What is the dataset? Why did you choose it?

The dataset is an API that I chose so that I could make a better prediction of the forecasr, not just using the Verde River near Camp Verde data. 

    What location have you chosen?

I chose to look at Montezuma Castle near Camp Verde.

    Where did you get the data from?

I got the data from the USGS and then used the mesonet data.

    What was your approach to accessing it?

I used the metadata website to look for a station, got the parameters needed and wanted to run the API for precipitation.

3. A plot of your additional time series along with your streamflow time series.

I could not get my metadata to work properly. The error was saying that the key error was "STATION". 

4. A plot that illustrates how you chose your forecast values.

The first graph shows the flow values from 2010-2019 for the last week of October
