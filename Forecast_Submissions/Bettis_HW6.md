Homework 6

__
## Grade: 
1/3: Good start however none of your plots came through. Also you don't have any formatting in your markdown so it is hard to read. Make sure you always preview your markdown before submitting. 
I'm guessing the problem with your plots is that you didn't copy the image folder into your repo. See me after class tomorrow and I can show you how to fix and resubmit.  Make sure you add formatting to your resubmission too. 

___

For your write up you should present your plots and for 
every plot provide a short summary of (1) how you made it, 
(2) why you made it and what it tells you.

Your submission should include at least:

6 plots total that are your own creation. You can use the 
starter code plots to get you going but must have made 
modifications to any plot you submit (e.g. changing the 
data that is plotting, changing colors, line styles, legends).

3 different types of plots (e.g. line plots, barplots, 
histograms, etc.)

Finally, provide discussion of your forecast values for the 
week and how they were informed by your plotting

####
Plot 1 is a line graph that shows the overall observed flow from 1989 to 2020. This is a good base graph as it shows flow over 30 years.

Plot 2 is a histogram that just breaks down the flow of Sepetmber and October. The histogram shows how many times the log flow was reported in the month. September seems to have higher flow rates than October, which will be helpful to know for my forecasting.

Plot 3 is a histogram that shows the flow for September, October, November, and December. This is helpful for forecasting to see flow in each month going forward.

Plot 4 is a scatter plot that shows the flow for 2019 and 2020 in October. This plot shows the variabilty in flow for the past 2 years, although 2020 was the second driest year on record.

Plot 5 is another line graph that shows the weekly average observed flow from 2015-2020 for the first two weeks of October. If I made the coding correctly, I believe that this shows that the first week typically has more rain than the second week, which is very helpful in determining the 1 week and 2 week forecast.

Plot 6 is a box plot of the flows by each month. Analyzing this for October, the median is around 110 cfs with the minimum being around 70 cfs and the max being around 1010 cfs.

###
For this weeks forecast, I chose a value of 120 cfs for 10/4 because I am hopeful for rain early this week with slight chances for the rest of the week. Also, based on plot 6, the median is around 110 so I chose a value slightly higher based on rain chances. For 10/11 I chose a value of 90 cfs, again mostly referencing plot 6, as I do not think the value would be as low as 70 cfs. Also plot 5 is helpful because I think it shows that the second week of October has less rain than the first.
