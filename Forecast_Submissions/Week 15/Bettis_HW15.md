Assignment 15

1. Using the UAHPC, I first logged in and then got onto the Pima interactive. The file was very small so I did not request much from it. I did install pandas and numpy for the python file to run correctly. The file had an error, so the total run time was only 0.03 seconds but it did output a file. I only waited in the queue for 2 minutes, so nothing took too long and was easy to run and find the correct directory. 

2. The most confusing part would have to be setting up everything for the correct environment, which we did in class. Besides the environment, I did have trouble creating the job and finding what I needed to change in order for the python script to run. This is probably the reason that the output that I wanted did not show up. 

3. I just have questions about submitting jobs but also the idea of the super computer. I understand that the best use for it would be for large datasets, but is it any different for the setup? How much time would be allotted just to install and set everything up where you wanted it to be?
