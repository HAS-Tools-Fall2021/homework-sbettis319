#Grades:
1. GitHub: 10/10!  Really nice job great summary and I like the addition of Bash on there.
2. Python Basics: 10/10 Great work!  per your question elif means if the first thing you checked was not true but some other condition is true.
3. Numpy 7/10: Good start but this is not really addressing the questions from the assignment. See me if you have questions. 
4. Pandas 10/10: Nice summary.
